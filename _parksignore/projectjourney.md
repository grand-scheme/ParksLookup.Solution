    Full CRUD functionality.
    successfully returns responses to API calls.
    
    Further exploration of one of the following objectives: authentication, versioning, pagination, Swagger documentation, or CORS.
    Complete documentation of API endpoints and the further exploration you did.

    Application includes CRUD functionality and successfully returns responses to API calls.
    Application includes at least one of the further exploration objectives: authentication, versioning, pagination, Swagger documentation, or CORS.
    Application is well-documented, including specific documentation on further exploration.
    Commit history clearly shows eight hours of work.
